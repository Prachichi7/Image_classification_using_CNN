# MNIST-Like 10-Class Classification Project

*Problem Statement*
The goal of this project is to build a neural network model to classify images into **10 distinct classes**. The original dataset had irregular label shapes `(10,10)` which needed to be fixed before training. The project demonstrates **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization** of performance metrics.

*Tech Stack Used*
- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for building and training the neural network
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations and data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting accuracy and loss curves
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – for project development and experimentation
