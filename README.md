# MNIST-Like 10-Class Classification Project

*Problem Statement*
The goal of this project is to build a neural network model to classify images into **10 distinct classes**. The original dataset had irregular label shapes `(10,10)` which needed to be fixed before training. The project demonstrates **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization** of performance metrics.

*Tech Stack Used*
- **Python 3.8+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for building and training the neural network
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations and data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib** – for plotting accuracy and loss curves
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – for project development and experimentation

*Project Structure*

MNIST-Classification/
├─ notebooks─ mnist_classification.ipynb
├─ saved_models- my_model.h5
├─ README.md─ requirements.txt  

*Steps to Run the Project*

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-classification.git
cd mnist-classification

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the notebook (mnist_classification.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run all cells to:
1)Preprocess the dataset
2)Train the model
3)Plot accuracy and loss
4)Save the trained model
